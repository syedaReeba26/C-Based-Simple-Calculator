# 🧮 C Basics: Simple Calculator

A beginner-friendly C program that demonstrates the use of **arithmetic**, **relational**, and **logical operators** with user input. It displays basic calculations and comparisons between two integers entered by the user.

---

## 🚀 Features

- 📥 Takes input of two signed integers
- ➕ Performs:
  - Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division
  - *(Note: Modulus line uses `|` bitwise OR mistakenly – should use `%`)*
- 🔁 Relational comparisons (==, !=, >, <, >=, <=)
- 🔐 Logical check for positivity using `if-else` and `&&` operator

---

## 🧠 Concepts Covered

- `scanf()` and `printf()`
- Signed integers
- Arithmetic operators: `+ - * /`
- Relational operators: `== != > < >= <=`
- Logical operator: `&&`
- Conditional check using `if-else`
- Bitwise operator: `|` *(used by mistake in modulus line)*

## ⚙️ How to Run

1. Open in any C compiler (e.g., Code::Blocks, DevC++, Turbo C++)
2. Compile and run the program
3. Enter two integers as prompted
4. View results of operations and condition checks

---

## 📌 Sample Output
Enter two integer numbers:
4 2
You entered a=4 & b=2.
Addition of 4 & 2 is: 6
Subtraction of 4 & 2 is: 2
Multiplication of 4 & 2 is: 8
Division of 4 & 2 is: 2
Modulus of 4 & 2 is: 6
